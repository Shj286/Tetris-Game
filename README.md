Tetris Game in Python

Welcome to my Tetris game developed in Python! ðŸŽ®

Introduction

I created this Tetris game during my free time to gain hands-on experience with Python and its libraries. This project was a fun way to deepen my understanding of programming concepts, game development, and graphical interfaces in Python.

Motivation

As someone passionate about both gaming and programming, I wanted to merge these interests by recreating one of the most classic games of all timeâ€”Tetris. This project allowed me to:

Explore Python Libraries: Get familiar with libraries such as pygame for game development and random for piece generation.
Understand Game Mechanics: Dive into how game logic works, including collision detection, scoring systems, and level progression.
Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Tackle challenges related to rendering graphics, handling user input, and optimizing game performance.
Features

Classic Gameplay: Experience the traditional Tetris game mechanics you know and love.
Shadow Preview: A shadow at the bottom shows where the current block will land, helping you plan your moves more strategically.
Scoring System: Keep track of your score as you clear lines.
Level Progression: Advance through levels that increase in difficulty.
Intuitive Controls: Use keyboard inputs for smooth gameplay.


Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.
Pygame: Install the Pygame library for handling graphics and game logic.
